<h1>Heap Sort Algorithm</h1>

<p style = "text-align = justify">
This project have two aplication of the Heap Sort algorithm in a real context and one implementation in C and other in C++, that load the legacy of this data struct in the real world, and your use for the society.
</p>

<h2>Develop of the aplication</h2>

<p style = "text-align = justify">
For develop this algorithms was necessary answer this questions:
</p>

* How build the Heap Sort algorithm in C?
* How build the Heap Sort algorithm in C++?
* Where use this algorithm, and if exist, how build this diferent use?


<p style = "text-align = justify">
The Heap Sort is compound by two procedures, the first is the Heap, that can maximum or minimum Heap, but in this project have just the maximum heap, because the two aplications in the real using the maximum heap.

In this gif, you can see that donÂ´t happend the ordination of the elements, but one element is change of position at some times, this happend for the struct of  the tree change for that she will tranformer into a tree of the heap ordination method, and with this is possible ordinate the list or vet of elements.
