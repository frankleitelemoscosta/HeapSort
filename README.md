<h1>Heap Sort Algorithm</h1>

<p style = "text-align = justify">
This project have two aplication of the Heap Sort algorithm in a real context and one implementation in C and other in C++, that load the legacy of this data struct in the real world, and your use for the society.
</p>

<h2>Develop of the aplication</h2>

<p style = "text-align = justify">
For develop this algorithms was necessary answer this questions:
</p>

* How build the Heap Sort algorithm in C?
* How build the Heap Sort algorithm in C++?
* Where use this algorithm, and if exist, how build this diferent use?
